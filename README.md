# No maglev trains

NewGRF for [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/) that disables maglev. Pairs well with the [no monorail](https://github.com/rexxars/openttd-no-monorail) NewGRF!

## Why?

I prefer regular trains! Having the maglev trains around when playing against other people/AIs makes it hard to stick with the regular trains, though. With this, everyone is on the same page.
